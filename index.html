    <p class="brown">The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely defined region in the western part
        of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
        Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery. The vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle is amongst the most
        heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas,
        Europe and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial
        and private aircraft routinely fly over it.</p>
  <p>The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
     The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this
        wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
